HTML element主要分兩種類型：block & inline

empty element(or void element) 沒有closing tag(ex:<img>,form裡面的<input>)
boolean attributes可以不用assign value,列出來就當做true

Whitespace in HTML:No matter how much whitespace you use (which can include space characters,but also line breaks),
 the HTML parser reduces each one down to a single space when rendering the code.
 So why use so much whitespace? The answer is readability — it is so much easier to understand what
 is going on in your code if you have it nicely formatted, and not just bunched up together in a
 big mess. In our HTML we've got each nested element indented by two spaces more than the one it is
 sitting inside. It is up to you what style of formatting you use (how many spaces for each level
 of indentation, for example), but you should consider formatting it.

example:
<p>Dogs are silly.</p>

<p>Dogs        are
         silly.</p>
are equal





[HTML] single or double quote???
